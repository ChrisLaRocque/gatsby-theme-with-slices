### `gatsby-theme-with-slices`

This directory is the theme package itself. You should rename this at
some point to be `gatsby-theme-{my-theme-name}`. Also change the
`package.json` name field and the corresponding dependency in the
example directory's `package.json`/`gatsby-config.js` to match the chosen name.

- `gatsby-theme-with-slices/`
  - `gatsby-config.js`: An empty gatsby-config that you can use as a starting point for building functionality into your theme.
  - `gatsby-node.js`: Minimal logic for declaring and creating the slices.
  - `index.js`: Since themes also function as plugins, this is an empty file that
    gatsby needs to use this theme as a plugin.
  - `package.json`: The dependencies that your theme will pull in when people install it. `gatsby` should be a `peerDependency`.
  - `src/components`: Arbitrary location for the slices, in this starter just `header.js`. When filesystem Slices support rolls out we could remove `gatsby-node` and put these files in the `/slices` directory.

### `example`

This is an example usage of your theme. It should look the same as the
site of someone who installed and used your theme from npm.

- `example/`
  - `gatsby-config.js`: Specifies which theme to use and any other one-off config a site might need.
  - `src/`: Source code such as one-off pages or components that might live in
    a user's site.

You can run the example with:

```shell
yarn workspace example develop
```
